			<h3>What exactly am I?</h3>
                        <p>
                            I am a <strong>mathematical constant</strong>, the ratio of a circle's circumference to 
                            its diameter, commonly approximated as <strong>3.14159</strong>. I've been represented by 
                            the Greek letter "&pi;" since the <strong>mid-18th century</strong>, though I've also 
                            sometimes spelt out as "pi".

			<h3>Who discovered me first?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Many ancient civilizations knew about me, but they could not find my exact value. Neither
                            could humans today. <strong>William Jones</strong> was the first to use the &pi; symbol to
                            represent the concept.

                            I'm celebrated on <strong>March 14</strong> every year. People usually eat pie on that day.

                        <h3>History</h3>
                        <p>
                            Ancient civilizations knew that there was a fixed <strong>ratio</strong> of circumference to diameter that was
                            approximately equal to three. The <strong>Greeks</strong> refined the process and <strong>Archimedes</strong> 
                            is credited with the first <strong>theoretical calculation</strong> of Pi. Pi was proven to be 
                            <strong>irrational</strong> in 1761.

                            &bull; Pi is the most recognized mathematical constant in the <strong>world</strong>.<br>
                            &bull; The symbol for pi (&pi;) has been used regularly in its mathematical sense only for the past <strong>250</strong> years.<br>
                            &bull; Computing pi is a stress test for a computer - a kind of "digital <strong>cardiogram</strong>."
